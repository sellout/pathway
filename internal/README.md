Implementation details for [Pathway](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pathway) that generally shouldn’t need to be depended on directly.

It is extracted into its own package to allow [Pathway QuickCheck integration](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pathway-quickcheck) to not depend on Pathway itself (avoiding a dependency cycle on Pathway’s tests).
